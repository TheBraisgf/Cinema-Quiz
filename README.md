## ❓ FAQ

#### + Will there be more updates?

-- Cinema Quiz was born as a learning project and, although we have made more modern adjustments in version 2, we do not believe that it will add much more to it.

Who knows, maybe the next step is a game in Unity.

#### + Can I use the code to make my own quiz?

-- Of course!
Also, we would feel very flattered if our first project is an inspiration for others who are starting in the wonderful world of JavaScript
